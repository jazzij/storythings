THINGS I COMMENTED OUT

_orderThing
_shapeID

PROBLEM:
RESOLVED: adjacent calculations are coming out wrong for saved shapes. I think this is because 
the contours are being calculated based on their position in their tiny contour image, rather than their position in the large image
eed to go back and verify this. 

First, check to see if the calculations are correct on a virgin run (no saved contours)
Also check to see what the distance measurements are in the adjacency detection method
- changed the == to be <=

RESOLVED: Why are empty contours being saved???? 
- the resize command that I commented out was necessary, but I don't know why... probably something downstream but I don't want to deal with it


RESOLVED!: THE CENTERS are being recognized as the same. See issue one-- are they being calculated based on position in 
large captured image or from the contour?
- the for loop that added up updated the storythings list was messed up

ISSUE: default rec topics are coming up empty when storythings are created :(((
- some upstream bugs. all fixed now

7:30pm fixed
to check: Combine is trying to act on a shape and not a thign
run through every rule
