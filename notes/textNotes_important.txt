#ON_SCENE_CHANGE return SHAPES[]. Given a landscape of shapes

## BACKGROUND: analyze the scene and calculate the proximity of all shapes to each other (mesh network)
1. For each detected shape, get center and the find object with closest x, y, and x,y

## RULES
class StoryThings( object):
		self.clipA = pygame.mixer.Sound(audiofile)
		self.clipB = brec 
		self.shape = shape
		self.rules = [ PLAY, COMBINE] #these are rules that this chip observes. by default all chips PLAY and COMBINE
		self.topics = ["keyword1", "keyword2",]
		self.subjects = ["keyword", "keyword",]
		self.timelock = seconds
		self.topicLock = None
		self.anti_topics = []
		self.morph_topics = [] #secondary topics of the brec
		
		self.LOCKED
		self.MORPHED

RULES to set a STATE
RULES that respond to a STATE + CONFIGURATION
-RESPONSES: 
 - generate some audio file
 - set a Thing.STATE

1. list of rules that set a state
2. list of rules that generate a file
3. order of rules (execution sequence)

#SILENCE (time) has the highest priority. A chip governed by this rule can heed no other interactions.
#MORPH is checked next. If a b-rec is activated, then the recording that all other rules act upon is the B-rec, rather than the A-rec.
#SILENCE( topical). Unless unlocked by topic, the recording is inactive (morph vs. silence: silence governed chips have no b-rec)  
#BLOCK is next. Any topic or subject in the active recording is blocked according to the settings of this.
#COMBINE the active recordings of current and adjacent chips are combined into the current chip, and the chips rules apply.
#PLAY - playback the recording


Set a State
SILENCE - set LOCK based on internal (timelock) or external (surround topic) criteria
COMBINE - change active clip to a new (external) recording.
MORPH - change active clip to a new (internal) recording 
BLOCK - change active clip to edited self recording

Configuration Responses 
MORPH - when 1 chip is present with a shared topic relevant to morph: give new internal audio file
COMBINE - when 1 chip is present with shared topic: generate new external audio file
BLOCK - when 1 chip is present with an anti-topic: generate a new internal audio file
PLAY - chip in PLAY_REGION


PRESENT: To the right 
SURROUND: All immediate positions (above, below, left, right)
SHARED_TOPIC: matchedTopics Non-empty
SHARED_TOPIC + MORPH: matchedTopics(type="morph")
ANTI_TOPIC : matchedTopics(type="anti")

EXTERNAL_AUDIO_FILE : otherChip is Audio_Chip, use otherChip's audioFile
INTERNAL_AUDIO_FILE : use self's audio

ACTIVE_CLIP : PRIMARY | SECONDARY



##### V2
AUDIO CHIP (basic)
Have TOPIC chips ( text recognition? those magnet things?)
CONTEXT chips (people, location, time)
